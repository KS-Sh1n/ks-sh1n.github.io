　Although economy was my major, in my honest opinion, studying economics in university wasn't fun. What makes economics fun, however, is when economics is tied with defiant ideas. Economist must be obsessed with science. Science gives reasoning. Thus, defiant ideas backed by science soon become a new trend. 

　Many can make world a better place, but most of them get rejected by the mainstream. One obvious example would be a bloakchain in late 2010s. Whatever the technology is, if it has a power to reshape the world, I will follow it as a role of economist.
