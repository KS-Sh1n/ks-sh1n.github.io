> ## **I'm in web3 business because...**

　**I am certain that the whole web3 industry and underlying blockchain technology will be a great thing.** Web3 industry has become one of most promising businesses and one of greatest opportunities. It's like being a pioneer to the unknown field. It's also like building a complete nation based on blockchain. Uncertainties may lie ahead, but opportunities would be greater.

　 **Blockchain technology has provided us a playground to build whatever we want and to play however we can.** Unique and entertaining atmosphere created on blockchain is attracting more people around the globe.

　 **Blockchain technology has a potential to make our life more secure and efficient.** NFT enables a room to make identification process more smooth. DeFi can remove barriers founded by traditional institutes and make some financial transaction fast without hassle.

　 Of course, I'm not saying that blockchain will change the world to the extent of destorying and reshaping everything. Blockchain itself also have problems, including forcing to fit blockchain to where is shouldn't be. **We should solve the problems and fit the blockchain to where it suits the most.**

> ## **I'm in DeFi because...**

　**it give me the highest possibility to be successful.** In capitalism, we should follow through the intersection of what market wants and what I good at. For me, DeFi is the answer. DeFi has a power to change financial industry. And DeFi is also where I can show my best performance.

　**I also love aspects of DeFi that traditional finance doesn't have.** In DeFi, we become a central bank in a small community. Building a healthy token economy will be crucual for a sustainable community. We can also weave several tokens together to maximize capital efficiency dubbed as DeFi lego.

> ## **I move together because...**

　**it's the most certain way to predict the future.** I think the best way to predict the future is creating the exact one that we want. That's why we must act by ourselves to make the future where blockchain technology is mainstream.

　To achieve future certainty, ironocally, we should take on and get through extreme uncertainties. It can't be done by a single person. That's why **we must get together amd share what we know to one another to achieve the objective.**
