　Although economy was my major, in my honest opinion, studying economics in university wasn't fun. What makes economics fun, however, is when economics is tied with defiant ideas. Economist must be obsessed with science. Science gives reasoning. Thus, defiant ideas backed by science soon become a new trend.
