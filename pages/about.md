> ## **I'm in crypto business because...**

　**I am certain that crypto or blockchain, more broadly speaking, will change the world.** Unique traits of blockchain such as decentralization, transparancy, and security have definitely their uses. NFT and DeFi would be some of applications.

　 Of course, I'm not saying that blockchain will change the world to the extent of destorying and reshaping everything. Blockchain itself also have problems, including forcing to fit blockchain to where is shouldn't be. **We should solve the problems and fit the blockchain to where it suits the most.**

> ## **I'm interested in DeFi because...**

　**it give me the highest possibility to be successful.** In capitalism, we should follow through the intersection of what market wants and what I good at. For me, DeFi is the answer. DeFi has a power to change financial industry. And DeFi is also where I can show my best performance.

　**I also love aspects of DeFi that traditional finance doesn't have.** In DeFi, we become a central bank in a small community. Building a healthy token economy will be crucual for a sustainable community. We can also weave several tokens together to maximize capital efficiency dubbed as DeFi lego.

> ## **I move together because...**

　**it's the most certain way to predict the future.** I think the best way to predict the future is creating the exact one that we want. That's why we must act by ourselves to make the future where blockchain technology is mainstream.

　To achieve future certainty, ironocally, we should take on and get through extreme uncertainties. It can't be done by a single person. That's why **we must get together amd share what we know to one another to achieve the objective.**
